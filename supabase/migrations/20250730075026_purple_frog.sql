  # Fix RLS policies for energy_purchases table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies on energy_purchases table
    - Add new policies that work with custom authentication system
    - Allow public access for energy purchases since app handles auth internally

  2. Changes Made
    - Remove auth.uid() dependency since app uses custom authentication
    - Allow public INSERT and SELECT operations
    - Maintain data integrity through application logic
